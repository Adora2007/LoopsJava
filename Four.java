//Notes
// counter++ is called increment operator;
//you can also write counter+1;
//anaylsing the code without writing is called dry run;
//there are 3 stages in a for loop(intialisation, termination, updation);
//It checks and updates;
//while condition means while doing;
// in do while even if it is true or false it will work for atleast 1;
